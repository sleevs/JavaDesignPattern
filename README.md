## Demonstration of Design Pattern implelemnted in Java 

Design pattern are beneficial because they describe a problem that occurs repeatedly
and explain the solution to the problem in a way that can be used many time over.

The study of patterns can inspire designes to come up with new and unique ideas
and format captures knowledge and documents best practices for a domain. 

Pattern are not the silver bullet but they can be combined and used in concert to solve large problems that cannot be solved with just one pattern .

### Creational patterns

  -  Factory Method 
      
     [In this example a logistic application was built  which implements a fare calculator.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-factory-method) 
  
  
  -  Abstract factory
  
     [In this example, an online payment application was created.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-abstract-factory)  
  
  -  Builder 
     
     [The example is a notification application which defines several ways to notify.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-builder)
  
  -  Prototype 
   
     [This is example of catalog of marketing place application.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-prototype)
  
  -  Singleton - TODO

### Structural patterns

  -  Adapter - TODO
  
  -  Bridge - TODO
  
  -  Composite - TODO
  
  -  Decorator - TODO
  
  -  Facade - TODO
  
  -  Flyweight - TODO
  
  -  Proxy - TODO

### Behavioral patterns

  -  Interpreter - TODO
     
  -  Chain of responsibility - TODO
  
  -  Command - TODO
  
  -  Iterator - TODO
  
  -  Mediator - TODO

     [This is a example of implementation of Mediator Pattern to solution of a Chat App with Server Push Technology.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern)

    
  
  -  Memento - TODO
  
  -  Observer - TODO
  
  -  State - TODO
  
  -  Strategy - TODO
  
  -  Template method - TODO
  
  -  Visitor - TODO
