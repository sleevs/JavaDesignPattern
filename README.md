## Demonstration of Design Pattern with Java 

### Creational patterns

  -  Factory 
      
      [In this example a logistic application was built  which implements a fare calculator.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-factory-method) 
  
  
  -  Abstract factory  
  
  -  Builder 
     
     [The example is a notification application which defines several ways to notify.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-builder)
  
  -  Prototype 
   
     [This is example of catalog of marketing place application.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-prototype)
  
  -  Singleton - 

### Structural patterns

  -  Adapter - 
  
  -  Bridge - 
  
  -  Composite - 
  
  -  Decorator - 
  
  -  Facade - 
  
  -  Flyweight - 
  
  -  Proxy - 

### Behavioral patterns

  -  Chain of responsibility - 
  
  -  Command - 
  
  -  Iterator - 
  
  -  Mediator - 
  
  -  Memento - 
  
  -  Observer - 
  
  -  State - 
  
  -  Strategy -
