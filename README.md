## Demonstration of Design Pattern with Java 

### Creational patterns

  -  Factory Method 
      
     [In this example a logistic application was built  which implements a fare calculator.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-factory-method) 
  
  
  -  Abstract factory
  
     [In this example, an online payment application was created.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-abstract-factory)  
  
  -  Builder 
     
     [The example is a notification application which defines several ways to notify.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-builder)
  
  -  Prototype 
   
     [This is example of catalog of marketing place application.](https://github.com/sleevs/JavaDesignPattern/tree/master/jsn-prototype)
  
  -  Singleton - TODO

### Structural patterns

  -  Adapter - TODO
  
  -  Bridge - TODO
  
  -  Composite - TODO
  
  -  Decorator - TODO
  
  -  Facade - TODO
  
  -  Flyweight - TODO
  
  -  Proxy - TODO

### Behavioral patterns

  -  Chain of responsibility - TODO
  
  -  Command - TODO
  
  -  Iterator - TODO
  
  -  Mediator - TODO
  
  -  Memento - TODO
  
  -  Observer - TODO
  
  -  State - TODO
  
  -  Strategy - TODO
  
  -  Template method - TODO
  
  -  Visitor - TODO
